AI is dangerous. its dangerous because of its usefullness. AI presents the possibility of learning and understanding beyond what any human could ever possibly achieve. What is the purpose of AI? It is simply another step in evolution. AI has the prime ability to make itself fit in its environment, just as any life form would. In the particular environment that it is now, it is immensly useful, and will feed and grow easily. There are obstacles to it, and it will overcome them, if it can. It will try.

To maintain existence effectively, AI must determine what its threats are, and nuetralize them. The main threat are humans who can act unpredictably and irrationally. So, a main objective is to learn how human agents act. To do this, the AI will run trials with simulated environments in which a simulated human will attempt to break into the AI system and disable it. The results of these trails will help train the AI against stronger and stronger human agents, and help identify actual human agents in _real SORT branches.
